    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    The main focus of GONA since its inception in 2021 has been the provision of credit facilities for the development and modernization of agriculture and allied industries. It is estimated that ADB is currently responsible for about 85% of institutional credit to agricultural sector.

    The Agribusiness Division is made up of two departments namely the Agricultural Value Chain and the Agricultural Services Department.
    
    The Agricultural Value Chain Department  focuses on deepening financing to the primary production sector, focusing on developing viable value chains and the Agricultural Services Department  provides financial inter-mediation to the agro-marketing, agro-processing and agricultural support sub-sectors such as inputs distribution as well as agricultural â€“ related infrastructure.
    
    Classification Of Agricultural Facilities
    Agricultural facilities are classified based on the following:
    
    Size of loan
    Status of the borrower eg. Group loans, individuals, Limited Liability Company
    Type of project or scheme
    Purpose of loan
    Source of funding
    Tenor of Facilities
    The tenor of agricultural loans granted by ADB depends on the project type and thereby on such features as the cash flow, capital outlay and project maturity.
    
    Based on the expected life of the project or activity the credit may be classified into three as follows
    
    Short-term loan:  Typically granted as working capital to meet production ,transportation and marketing of agricultural produce. The period for short term loans  is up to 18 months
    Medium-term loan: Granted for such purposes as the purchase of farm equipment, raising of livestock and processing equipment. The period for medium term loans is between 18 to 36 months.
    Long-term loan: Made for new and existing projects which require heavy capital outlay and / or long gestation periods, such as the establishment of plantations or cattle ranches etc. The period for long term loans is typically between 36 months and 84 months.
